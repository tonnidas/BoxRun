# BoxRun
A Beginner Level Desktop based 3D Game with 3 levels

#### Technical details: 
- We used Unity and C# programming language.

#### Description:
- It was a beginner level desktop based 3D Game with 3 levels along with a start and end page. A person can run this game directly using the `BOXRUN` file in windows based pc. Click that button on the website and download the file and run it. 
- Its player is a movable cube that the user/player could move only right or left. 
- The cube always moves forward with a constant speed in each level. As the level goes up, the speed of the cube goes up too. It means that in level one the speed is moderate without any acceleration. after passing the level one, player moves to level two and here, the speed is more than the level one. the speed is default.
- The cube runs through a road full of objects. Main goal of the player is to successfully reach the end of the path in each level by passing all the obstacles to go to next level. Once the player has completed all the three levels, he has finished this game. (However, the third levels speed was insanely high which made it hard to pass).
- The cube maintains the physics of law (while colliding and moving).
- User will play on the player cubes perspective.
